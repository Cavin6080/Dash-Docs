# Introduction

We're using [`auto_route`](https://pub.dev/packages/auto_route) package for the routing. They helps us to use the newer `Navigator 2.0` API while keeping the learning curve as much low as possible. The boilerplate comes with the routing setup out of the box. Thus, this guide will help you to create your own routes.

Follow the steps for creating your own routes in the project:

## 1. Annotating the screen 

Let's say you're creating a `HomeScreen` widget and you want to add that in your routes. The code should look something like this:

```java jsx title="home-screen.dart"
    class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
    const HomeScreen({super.key});

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return ...your code;
    }
    }
```

1. Import the Auto Route package into your file:

`import 'package:auto_route/auto_route.dart';`

2. Annotate your Widget by **@RoutePage()** like this:

```java jsx title="home-screen.dart" {1}
    @RoutePage()
    class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
    const HomeScreen({super.key});

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return ...your code;
    }
    }
```

:::caution
Make sure that your Screen's name is either ending with `Page` or `Screen`. (E.g HomeScreen, HomePage)
:::


## 2. Adding the route in `app_router.dart`

1. Add your route in `app_router.dart` like this:

```java jsx title="app_router.dart" {12}
@AutoRouterConfig(replaceInRouteName: 'Page|Screen,Route')
class AppRouter extends _$AppRouter {
  @override
  List<AutoRoute> get routes => [
        AutoRoute(
          initial: true,
          page: SplashRoute.page,
          guards: [
            AuthGuard(),
          ],
        ),
        AutoRoute(page: HomeRoute.page),
      ];
}
```

4. Finally, run the `build_runner` command to generate the routes.

```zsh
dart run build_runner build
```
