# Configure Environment Variables

We're using [`envied`](https://pub.dev/packages/envied) package for the environment variables since it encryptes every key values inside your `.env` files. By default, the Dart side of the environment files will be already given for your **Base API URL** and **environment name**. But you will need to create the `.env` files in order to utilize it in your Flutter App.

## 1. Configure default environment variables:

To configure environment variables inside your Flutter project, Follow the steps below:

1. Create 2 files at the **root level** of your project and name like this:
    - `.env.dev`
    - `.env.prod`


2. Now, Add this 2 variables inside both env files like this:

```env jsx title=".env.dev"
BASE_API_URL=YOUR API URL
ENV=Development
```

:::caution
ENV key for `.env.dev` will be **Development** but it will be **Production** for `.env.prod`
:::

:::warning
Don't commit your .env file to a (public/private) repository.

3. Now run the Flutter Build Runner command in order to generate your encrypted environment variables.

```zsh
dart run build_runner build
```

## 2. Adding your own environment variables:

Adding your own environment variables is as easy as defining it. To add your own environment variables, follow the steps below:

1. Add your variables in the `.env` files. Let's say you want to add `PATH` variable for only `.env.dev`, then you will do it like this:

```env jsx title=".env.dev"
BASE_API_URL=https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
ENV=Development
PATH=Home
```

2. Now, Go to `app_config.dart` inside the `lib -> app -> config`. There will be am abstract class called `EnvDev`. Add your `PATH` variable like this:

```java jsx title="app_config.dart"
@Envied(path: '.env.dev')
abstract class EnvDev {
  @EnviedField(varName: 'BASE_API_URL', obfuscate: true)
  static final String ENV_BASE_API_URL = _EnvDev.ENV_BASE_API_URL;
  @EnviedField(varName: 'ENV', obfuscate: true)
  static final String ENV_NAME = _EnvDev.ENV_NAME;
  @EnviedField(varName: 'PATH', obfuscate: true)
  static final String ENV_PATH = _EnvDev.ENV_PATH;
}
```

3. Now run the Flutter Build Runner command in order to generate your encrypted environment variables.

```bash
dart run build_runner build
```

4. The last step is to create the **getters** for the variable. You can look into the implementation of other getter variables inside the `app_config.dart` file in order to implement it.

## 3. Bonus 💙

If you ever have to render a widget based on the environment, then you can do it like this:

```java jsx title="app-screen.dart"
/// Here you can take any env, for this demo we're taking `development`
if (AppConfig.environment==Env.development) {
    ....
  }
```



:::tip
If you're changing the content of the `.env` files after you configure them, then make sure to run these commands in sequence:

```zsh
dart run build_runner clean
dart run build_runner build -d
```
