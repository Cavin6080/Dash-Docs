## Creating a new project from Boilerplate ©️

To create a new project using the **Boilerplate**, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the **Github Repository** of the Boilerplate by running the command below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cavin-7span/bloc_boilerplate.git
```
:::warning
This repository is private as of now so in case of any issue. You can reach out to 
[Cavin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cavin-macwan/)
:::

You can type this command into **Command Prompt**, **Powershell**, **Terminal**, or any other **integrated terminal** of your code editor.

2. After you clone the repository, you'll have to setup the environment variables. To setup that, you can follow this [link](https://cavin-7span.github.io/Dash-Docs/docs/tutorial-basics/configuring-environment-variables) for the complete tutorial on this.

3. After that, create new folders in the **assets** folders if any of this does not exists in this:
  - images
  - l10n
  - icons
  - fonts


4. Run the below command to configure the code generation files:

```bash
dart run build_runner build
```

5. At last, run this command to get all the packages:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Launch your App

Launch your app by either through your IDE or by running the command below:

```bash
flutter run -t lib/main_development.dart
```

- `flutter pub get`:  Installs the neccessary dependencies for your project ⬇️

- `flutter run -t lib/main_development.dart`:  Builds your flutter app and launches that on
either emulator or your device 🚀

We invite contributions from the whole team. Please review the Contributing to Boilerplate documentation and Contributor access page on our wiki to get started.


## Opening issues
